<h1>Resist</h1>

<p>There are no signs in the sky tonight<br>
Nothing in the air to suggest the time<br>
Is close at hand for a change<br>
A shift is ready, a new path to chart</p>

<p>There comes a time, a time to begin<br>
And we've spent days in the wind<br>
Sometimes it's too late<br>
Too late for eyes to open</p>

<p>There's everything wrong<br>
And nothing to be done<br>
And we watch this farce<br>
We allowed this to happen</p>

<p>There's a time to resist<br>
A time to fight back<br>
Their roots are deep<br>
Nevertheless, we will persist</p>

<p>Weary and defeated<br>
We take our place<br>
One among many<br>
Is all hope lost?</p>

<p>Weary and defeated<br>
We take our place<br>
One among many<br>
Will all hope be lost?</p>

<p>There's a time to resist<br>
A time to fight back<br>
Their roots are deep<br>
Nevertheless, we will persist</p>
