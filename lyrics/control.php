<h1>Control</h1>

<p>walk through the door<br>
into her night time orb<br>
leading light away from you<br>
she's standing in the shadows<br>
reshaping the room<br>
for her intentions<br>
she slams your doors<br>
and hides inside the walls</p>

<p>lead their dreams in rivers<br>
flowing streams of love and hate<br>
each night she enters<br>
she's the master of your fate</p>

<p>entering their minds<br>
she stares the good thoughts down<br>
sleeping children cry inside the horror of her arms<br>
unfeeling of emotion<br>
she will smother and encompass you<br>
don't run away<br>
you cannot hide</p>
