<h1>Spirit and Image</h1>

<p>Spending time flying standby<br>
Through places where life and time are still<br>
There's a light I find<br>
Dimly lit upon the furthest point<br>
And if I try, maybe I&hellip;</p>

<p>Somewhere resides a path<br>
A tunnel to crawl through<br>
And if I try, maybe I&hellip;<br>
Maybe I could try</p>

<p>Spending time painting corners<br>
Scuffs and scrapes and bridges long since burned<br>
There's a light I find<br>
Dimly lit upon the furthest point<br>
And if I try, maybe I&hellip;</p>

<p>Somewhere resides a path<br>
A tunnel to crawl through<br>
And if I try, maybe I&hellip;<br>
Maybe I could try</p>

<p>It's time to step away<br>
To spend less time fighting me<br>
Would it be the first<br>
A manifestation of a dream<br>
The apocalypse of chimera<br>
If I twist apart reality<br>
It doesn't matter what they claim<br>
This is what I choose to be<br>
A phantom exposed within<br>
Peels away opposing power</p>
