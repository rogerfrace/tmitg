<h1>Failure</h1>

<p>inventions are the figures of the mind<br>
no way to cope with failure<br>
not nearly ideal time<br>
to illicit this behavior</p>

<p>regressions are the signs of changing style<br>
these things we can endeavor<br>
to keep with passing times<br>
i have to cope with failure</p>

<p>what can i see<br>
the same as you<br>
i want to be<br>
everything in you<br>
what can you see<br>
trying to copy you<br>
everything to be<br>
i am in you</p>

<p>processions are the easy path to smile<br>
in line with all the others<br>
not nearly ideal time<br>
why should i even bother</p>

<p>repressions are what i live today<br>
a lot of nothing<br>
in my brain<br>
i think i am a failure</p>
