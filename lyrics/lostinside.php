<h1>Lost in Side</h1> 

<p><i>words by John McDonagh</i></p>

<p>dreams of self in the darkening light<br>
a lingering scent of eternal night<br>
wolves howl long and the people scream<br>
clenching their bones with forbidden dreams</p>

<p>alone in pain with no one here<br>
fear to scream, fear to tear<br>
darkness sighs and all is clear<br>
for only shadows can draw near</p>

<p>wandering paths that were never trod<br>
why weren't you there by the holy pond?<br>
I see the waters of that misty day<br>
images of love keep me away</p>

<p>this is for you and you alone<br>
there's nothing left of my emotion<br>
a lost embrace within my mind<br>
thoughts so bright my eyes go blind</p>
