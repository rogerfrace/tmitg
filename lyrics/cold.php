<h1>Cold</h1>

<p>the beautiful have come<br>
to take me away<br>
a deep dark grave<br>
awaits its day<br>
the coldness of the flowers<br>
is my only warmth<br>
for the cold is the darkness<br>
that is left all alone</p>

<p>cold eyes gaze<br>
upon the cold stone<br>
tear filled eyes<br>
as she mourns all alone</p>

<p>the beautiful have come<br>
and taken me away<br>
the deep dark grave<br>
has seen its day<br>
the flowers have died<br>
the people gone home<br>
I'm left cold in the darkness<br>
left cold and all alone</p>
