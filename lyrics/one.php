<h1>One</h1>

<p>Go wherever you are from<br>
Beneath the skin of the waves<br>
You have come from the waters<br>
In the essence of the air</p>

<p>You are not the one who's lost<br>
For the others, they know<br>
Of the rain in your hopes<br>
In the land of the one</p>

<p>You see all, you assume all<br>
On a rock all alone<br>
Turn away from your shame<br>
Hide your face</p>

<p>Feelings about the way<br>
Things are around you<br>
Don't let that slip away<br>
Why not hold on?</p>
