<h1>Find a Way</h1>

<p>Every deed is on us<br>
Carry on with every thought<br>
Somehow we find the strength<br>
To go on</p>

<p>There is one isolated system<br>
May the future grant us the view<br>
In a time of living history<br>
This is who we come to be</p>

<p>There are worlds<br>
Apart from worlds<br>
Places in between<br>
We never see, we never see</p>

<p>Far and away<br>
And in dreams<br>
The space that follows me<br>
The worlds that came to be</p>

<p>And now I can never know<br>
Who they were<br>
Float away<br>
Find a way</p>

<p>Float away<br>
We'll find our way</p>
