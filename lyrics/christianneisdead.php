<h1>Christianne is Dead</h1>

<p>the end comes close and the falling rain<br>
like tears driving hard on her skin<br>
the coldness of the iron grips her throat<br>
reminiscing of her sin<br>
repeating the words over and over <br>
she prays yet doubts what comes next<br>
her words get caught in her throat<br>
there is no future that is fixed</p>

<p>christianne is dead<br>
she doesn't want to feel anymore<br>
christianne is dead<br>
i can't live to lie anymore<br>
the darkest abscess of her heart is fear that makes her see<br>
only the light from high above can pierce her soul and set her free</p>

<p>she sits high on a cloud of mist<br>
absorbing light from above<br>
she turns her back and feels desire<br>
unable to think, unable to move<br>
she falls from grace like falling rain<br>
like tears driving hard on her skin<br>
water burns like fire, crying she came<br>
there is no future only pain</p>
