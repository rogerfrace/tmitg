<h1>Spider's Bride</h1>

<p><em>Words by Dan Neet and Roger Frac&eacute;</em></p>

<p>we are watching while you sleep<br>
we are the nightmares in your dreams<br>
we are everywhere <br>
we are everywhere<br>
we are the ones snatching souls<br>
we are the ones in control<br>
we are everywhere <br>
we are everywhere</p>

<p>come let me put my arms around you<br>
come let me pray beside you<br>
come let show you a true god</p>

<p>feelings of submission<br>
the ageless come<br>
the dust in a darkened corner<br>
seems so alive<br>
watching eyes<br>
spiders peer over me</p>

<p>eight legged angels spin by night<br>
catching all misguided flying by<br>
a living god who waits patiently<br>
without a twitch<br>
body snatching technique very quick</p>

<p>don't lie<br>
why'd you lie<br>
don't deny it to yourself<br>
this time</p>
