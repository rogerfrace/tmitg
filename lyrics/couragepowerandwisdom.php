<h1>Courage, Power, and Wisdom</h1>

<p>Hey, listen!</p>

<p>In becoming something<br>
Does my old self cease to be<br>
Does my path yet unfold<br>
Or have I seen all there is to see</p>

<p>Where the fallen keep me<br>
Where the temple of time<br>
Brings me to find my way<br>
With courage, power, and wisdom</p>

<p>Three spiritual stones I find<br>
To aid me<br>
To unlock my destiny<br>
And call forth the hero in me</p>

<p>I cannot find the right way through<br>
Help me, guide me<br>
(Hey, listen!)<br>
Where the stone dances<br>
There may be a way for me</p>

<p>Behind and ahead<br>
A labyrinth of being<br>
Hiding a map<br>
And a compass</p>

<p>To find a way through<br>
To the ending<br>
I'll find the pieces<br>
Of my heart there</p>

<p>So I bring my magic forth<br>
A song of sun<br>
I ride along<br>
To bring her home</p>

<p>I cannot find the right way through<br>
Help me, guide me<br>
(Hey, listen!)<br>
Where the stone dances<br>
There may be a way for me</p>

<p>Three spiritual stones I find<br>
To aid me, to unlock my destiny<br>
And call forth<br>
The hero within me</p>
