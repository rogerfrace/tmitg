<h1>Dark Splintered Heart</h1><br>

<p><i>inspired by the journal of Abbey Greenbaum</i></p>

<p>my mouth opened by a scream<br>
my body bound in chains<br>
my soul corrupted by darkness<br>
my heart filled with pain<br>
my eyes burned with images<br>
my ears ringing with bells<br>
my stomach taken by nausea<br>
my hands pierced with nails</p>

<p>body to body, fear to fear<br>
eye to eye, tear to tear<br>
body to body, pain to pain<br>
mouth to mouth, again and again&hellip;</p>

<p>all that i wanted, all that i could<br>
of your deep dark splintered heart<br>
i do what i know, i do what i should<br>
dear god don't tear me apart</p>

<p>my eyes saw your troubles<br>
my mouth spoke your words<br>
my ears heard your screams<br>
my ideas destroyed your world</p>

<p>body to body, fear to fear<br>
eye to eye, tear to tear<br>
body to body, pain to pain<br>
mouth to mouth, again and again&hellip;</p>

<p>all that i wanted, all that i could<br>
of your deep dark splintered heart<br>
i do what i know, i do what i should<br>
dear god don't tear me apart</p>

<p>all that you wanted, all that you could<br>
see the pain in my eyes<br>
drive your anger into my soul<br>
don't know the reasons why</p>

<p>all that i wanted, all that i could<br>
of your deep dark splintered heart<br>
i do what i know, i do what i should<br>
dear god don't tear me apart</p>
