<h1>Cry</h1>

<p>I cry for the things you know<br>
the things that you must say</p>

<p>fly my soul into the air<br>
it isn't as though you don't know<br>
by now they all know<br>
and all I can do is cry</p>

<p>these are the things we can't see<br>
places we will never go<br>
feelings we won't encounter<br>
lives we don't want to live</p>
