<h1>Outside</h1>

<p>will I ever be there?<br>
will they ever care?</p>

<p>there was never a time<br>
with any meaning<br>
never a place<br>
to find a beginning</p>

<p>the words never spoken<br>
and the past long forgotten<br>
the road never traveled<br>
and the memories now gone</p>

<p>why don't you see them?<br>
I'm sure you know them<br>
why can't you hear them?<br>
for they are there</p>

<p>the future never happened<br>
and the feeling displaced<br>
as if in some other light<br>
and into the dawn of the day</p>

<p>a thought outside of time<br>
it could just go away<br>
transparent eyes look inside<br>
through to my senses</p>

<p>these games they play<br>
I'm on the outside<br>
I feel so far away</p>
