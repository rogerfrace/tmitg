<h1>Christianne is Dead</h1>

<p>the end comes close and the falling rain<br />
like tears driving hard on her skin<br />
the coldness of the iron grips her throat<br />
reminiscing of her sin<br />
repeating the words over and over <br />
she prays yet doubts what comes next<br />
her words get caught in her throat<br />
there is no future that is fixed</p>

<p>christianne is dead<br />
she doesn't want to feel anymore<br />
christianne is dead<br />
i can't live to lie anymore<br />
the darkest abscess of her heart is fear that makes her see<br />
only the light from high above can pierce her soul and set her free</p>

<p>she sits high on a cloud of mist<br />
absorbing light from above<br />
she turns her back and feels desire<br />
unable to think, unable to move<br />
she falls from grace like falling rain<br />
like tears driving hard on her skin<br />
water burns like fire, crying she came<br />
there is no future only pain</p>
