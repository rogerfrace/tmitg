<h1>Wonderland</h1>

<p>feel the water that falls down<br>
and washes me clean<br>
from all the stars of the fears<br>
that linger in my dreams</p>

<p>I want to drive my eyes away<br>
no more to wonder<br>
taken in the hands of fate<br>
days filled with thunder</p>

<p>here we are here we stand<br>
trapped inside this wonderland<br>
moving in circles falling around<br>
they go up but we fall down</p>

<p>I hear you again<br>
again, again<br>
I hear you again<br>
again, again</p>

<p>the nights drown away in stars<br>
growing deeper and colder<br>
nothing can awake my mind<br>
another year older</p>

<p>why we always soon forget<br>
with no reason<br>
how low we are again<br>
gone with the seasons</p>
