<h1>Far From Home</h1>

<p>When she fair and lonely<br>
Finds her heart far from home<br>
Beloved of that wondrous place<br>
Why did she ever roam?</p>

<p>Wandering across the hills at nigh<br>
All that she loved is lost<br>
To find her way back again<br>
Would come at to high a cost</p>

<p>Outcast of her own accord<br>
And fallen far away<br>
She searched her soul for the answers there<br>
In the depths of night and day</p>

<p>Growing old and weary <br>
Walking a forbidden path<br>
Taking a journey beyond her sphere<br>
She feared the lady's wrath</p>

<p>She found her way home at last<br>
Raising her arms up high<br>
Tears gleamed within her eyes<br>
The rose into the sky</p>
