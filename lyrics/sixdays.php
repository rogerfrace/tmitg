<h1>Six Days</h1>

<p>how can you find her there<br>
when she can't even find herself<br>
why weren't you with her there<br>
when she always needed you</p>

<p>we twist<br>
6 days 6 days we're weeping<br>
we're weeping there<br>
6 days 6 days we fall<br>
we fall<br>
6 days 6 days we twist<br>
6 days here</p>

<p>found at just the wrong time<br>
loved at just the right<br>
what can you be right here<br>
are you a dream in her eyes</p>

<p>these days and nights concede<br>
as the illusions fade away<br>
and as the darkness falls<br>
open her up and feel her pain</p>
