<h1>Masks</h1>

<p>we are lost into the fire<br>
but time is not within our minds<br>
and words expose the depth within<br>
tearing trauma deep inside</p>

<p>searing light dancing by<br>
the lost ones inside their minds<br>
channeling madness in the dark<br>
wakeful silence holding close</p>

<p>the masquerade dances on<br>
hidden thoughts without faces<br>
cutting through your<br>
frightened eyes</p>

<p>the time is now, the masks collide<br>
their faces dancing without minds<br>
why we never hoped to care<br>
to see the sorrows exposed</p>

<p>the spotlights shine on their cold stares<br>
the dust creeps inside our minds<br>
mindless forms without thought<br>
find existence outside time</p>

<p>will they see you?<br>
they won't love you<br>
fading away</p>
