<h1>Wasted Time</h1>

<p>lost or stolen<br>
truth in time<br>
sits upon the hill<br>
battered and frail thoughts<br>
are falling in mine own<br>
mine own house<br>
is where i find them there<br>
of the conscious clear<br>
and told of far away<br>
we have a place<br>
where we can save them<br>
the thoughts take me by<br>
the dust keeps falling down<br>
the wind takes their scent away<br>
look in front<br>
but never far behind<br>
their faces shy away<br>
they will take you there<br>
you'll see them waiting<br>
a breath upon your neck<br>
the skin of our lives<br>
waiting to find the one day<br>
find the one place<br>
know the meaning<br>
of their wasted time<br>
we are still wasting time<br>
the nothing of the day<br>
i waited so long<br>
waited there but<br>
nothing, nothing no one, nothing<br>
will take away the wasted time<br>
we wasted time</p>
