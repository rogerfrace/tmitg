<h1>Echo</h1>

<p>it seems strange<br>
the way their thoughts bang around<br>
inside stair steps<br>
up and down</p>

<p>echo, it echoes<br>
before and after</p>

<p>going in<br>
the wrong direction<br>
and I know<br>
we won't reach our destination<br>
in my head<br>
bring me around to the exit<br>
get me out<br>
I can't see through</p>

<p>all around me<br>
I did this to myself<br>
all around me<br>
echo, it just echoes</p>
