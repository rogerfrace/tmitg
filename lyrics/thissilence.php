<h1>This Silence</h1>

<p>Deep in the nothing of my doubts<br>
It draws them further on the stream<br>
I own the way down through<br>
Sinking, falling over and away</p>

<p>They are not waiting for me now<br>
It knows the promises they bring<br>
The lights would shine true in my eyes<br>
A moment far, far away</p>

<p>Here we are<br>
I know I will reach the end<br>
From across<br>
I don't see this silence, no, no, no&hellip;</p>

<p>What would it take to fall asleep<br>
To slip deep into the veil<br>
Far beneath eternity<br>
Hidden with secrecy, stolen away</p>

<p>But time knows nothing any more<br>
For their travels in the dreams<br>
The clocks are ticking down<br>
Storm's travels taken all away</p>
