<h1>Heavenly Air</h1> 

<p><i>words by Aeschylus. adapted by Roger Frac&eacute;</i></p>

<p>she broke away in the middle of her speech<br>
and she flees from the light<br>
she turned away from the sight of man<br>
fleeing though the night</p>

<p>midway between heaven and earth<br>
so much with its top towards heavenly air<br>
so much with its roots towards the earth<br>
so much with its top towards heavenly air</p>

<p>half dead in her bosom<br>
she embraces her offspring<br>
and three times she erected herself<br>
and three times she fell</p>
