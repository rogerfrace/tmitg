We started the year by finishing our sixth album, <i>Shadow Puppets</i>, which was released in April with great critical success. <p>What's in store for 2006? While the Machine in the Garden takes a break, Summer has been busy in the studio. For her debut in electronica music, Summer performs guest vocals for a track on the new <a href=\"http://www.tsdf.net/\">The Synthetic Dream Foundation</a> album, <i>Tendrils of Pretty</i>. You can listen to a clip of the song entitled \"Auf dem See\" at the <a href=\"http://www.mythicalrecords.com/tsdf.htm\">Mythical Records website</a>. Summer is also working with Dru Allen on the next <a href=\"http://www.mirabilismusic.com/\">Mirabilis</a> release. Dru and Summer have completed several songs and are very exciting about the direction of their next work.<p>As a special gift to ring in 2006, we are offering $3 off when you order 2 or more items from the <a href=\"http://www.tmitg.com/merch.php\">merchandise store at tmitg.com</a>.
