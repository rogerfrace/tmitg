<h1>Primevil</h1>

<p>reaching toward empyrean<br>
abode of paradise above<br>
ignorant in life, innocent in death<br>
the ones who took to dreaming<br>
you can find them waiting<br>
in a realm of fire, ambit of light<br>
emblazoned in their minds<br>
an elegy of fright</p>

<p>are eyes like stars burning bright<br>
like pinholes in the sky<br>
and how far can they see<br>
elusive faces turning white</p>

<p>hidden faces in the dark<br>
lie in the fear of secrets<br>
afraid of surprise, superstition cries<br>
words that deny their feelings<br>
gone without a whisper<br>
in the shelter of the ground<br>
bodies curl like broken molds<br>
disappear without a sound</p>

<p>are eyes like stars burning bright<br>
like pinholes in the sky<br>
and how far can they see<br>
elusive faces turning white<br>
descend from flurries in the clouds<br>
the captives in the ground</p>
