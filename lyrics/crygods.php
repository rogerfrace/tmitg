<h1>CryGods</h1>

<p>the gods are crying and the clouds are blowing overhead<br>
the gathering in black for the mourning of the dead<br>
rain falling in torrents bringing life to the ground<br>
no way to break the feelings to which i am bound</p>

<p>a single black dress flows whispfully in the wind<br>
the woman underneath her heart as black as sin<br>
no way to understand the feelings she has found<br>
no way to break the feelings to which she is bound</p>
