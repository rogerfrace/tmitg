<h1>Beyond</h1>

<p>Come in, we've been waiting</p>

<p>A circle of life and love and death<br>
Figure of myth and dreams<br>
The feeling of flight out of my own skin</p>

<p>I turn to the north, then south, east and west<br>
Something tugs my heart within me<br>
I call to the sun above me</p>

<p>Can they save you?<br>
Things are just beginning<br>
Secure your path ahead</p>

<p>The depth is thicker here<br>
Where there is no air<br>
And expanding to breathe</p>

<p>Beyond&hellip;</p>

<p>Don't waste your time<br>
It doesn't matter anyway<br>
This is the end</p>

<p>Can they save you?<br>
Things are just beginning<br>
Secure your path ahead</p>

<p>The moon rises high above me<br>
And lights the way<br>
Burning away the blame</p>

<p>The senses are intense<br>
Secure within the space<br>
I swim out beyond</p>

Beyond&hellip;</p>
