<h1>Midnight</h1>

<p>glistening in the snow<br>
the world carries on<br>
now I find the time has come<br>
the truth I face alone</p>

<p>tell them they don't love you<br>
ask them if they care<br>
the coldness of their faces<br>
the burden they all bear</p>

<p>it finds me<br>
clouds parting<br>
invades me<br>
midnight standing there</p>

<p>the winters they have come<br>
to cast on brighter days<br>
silver stars in blackness<br>
slowly find their way</p>

<p>as the nighttime falls<br>
the children they all gasp<br>
closed up tight for dreaming<br>
you know they are the last</p>

<p>tonight the silent stillness<br>
now has come<br>
to put the world in motion<br>
tonight it must be done</p>
