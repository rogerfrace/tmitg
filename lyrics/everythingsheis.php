<h1>Every Thing She Is</h1>

<p>night wonders are wilder<br>
holding higher up so low<br>
stars glisten my tears away<br>
sun evaporates the stains</p>

<p>if i can hold them<br>
i will dream them<br>
we will find them<br>
they will fall<br>
there's a place there<br>
it will drown you<br>
we will find them<br>
they will fall</p>

<p>everything she thinks has<br>
shattered something there again<br>
nowhere can you look down<br>
and find the piece in me</p>

<p>it's a blurred and vicious day<br>
you'll never find it<br>
you would find me inside again<br>
how soon it crumbles</p>

<p>she sits<br>
she dreams<br>
she loves<br>
she knows<br>
she understands<br>
she lives<br>
she hates<br>
she learns<br>
she regrets<br>
she stumbles<br>
she hurts<br>
she cannot remember<br>
she is never the same</p>
