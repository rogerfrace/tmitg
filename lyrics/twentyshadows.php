<h1>Twenty Shadows</h1>
<p>words from <i>Richard II</i> by Shakespeare. adapted by Summer Bowman</p>

<p>each substance of grief, hath twenty shadows<br>
which shows like grief itself, but is not so<br>
for sorrows' eye, glazed with blinding tears<br>
divides one thing entire to many objects<br>
like perspectives, which gazed upon show nothing but confusion<br>
eyed awry, distinguished form, find shapes of grief more than himself 
to wail<br>
which for things true weeps though things imaginary<br>
for sorrows' eye, glazed with blinding tears<br>
divides one thing entire to many objects</p>
