<h1>Everything Alone</h1>

<p>she said that I could not have<br>
all the things I wanted<br>
and in the end I found<br>
the span of fortune's decade</p>

<p>and as the years pass by<br>
feeding non-emotion<br>
more of the world I possess<br>
less of myself I encompass</p>

<p>never needing intangible<br>
their joys and their sorrows<br>
why should I care to find<br>
a love to last past tomorrow</p>

<p>and in the end I find<br>
does it really matter<br>
what things we take with us<br>
to be alone with everything<br>
is to be alone&hellip;</p>
