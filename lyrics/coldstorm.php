<h1>Cold Storm</h1>

<p>Water vapor rises around me<br>
Tendrils like fingers in my hair<br>
Coiled around my head<br>
A crown in a winter court</p>

<p>Snow falling gently<br>
Creates a soft blanket<br>
A place to rest my head<br>
And calm a fiery soul</p>

<p>A burning castle out of control<br>
Our kingdom entranced by fools<br>
And at the end of the day<br>
A cold storm burned</p>

<p>An emerging fiend, slowly<br>
As if from delusions<br>
Breaks and swells in the tide<br>
Of visions and fears and lies</p>

<p>A narrow trail forms<br>
Through the dense copse<br>
How strange could it be<br>
To fly away and dream again</p>

<p>The dead of night rings in my ears<br>
Quiet screaming and wary eyes<br>
Watching and moving, writhing<br>
My silence as gentle as a knife</p>

<p>A burning castle out of control<br>
Our kingdom entranced by fools<br>
And at the end of the day<br>
A cold storm burned</p>

<p>Rainfall hard, then gentle<br>
I see their figures in the mist<br>
A shadow in bands of light<br>
And then their eyes close</p>
