<h1>The Piano</h1>

<p>on the darkened stage<br>
he takes his place<br>
black and white<br>
beneath his hands</p>

<p>waiting in the wings<br>
she doesn't speak <br>
but listens, quietly<br>
sustain, rise and fall</p>

<p>neverending melody<br>
a spell in the dark<br>
fingers dancing <br>
on the keys</p>

<p>the night is broken<br>
a subtle shift occurrs<br>
all those gathered<br>
breathe as one</p>

<p>nothing else can echo now<br>
the story has ended<br>
he nods <br>
and takes his leave</p>

<p>we felt deeply there<br>
something more than truth<br>
across the boards<br>
where memories lie</p>
