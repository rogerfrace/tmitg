<h1>Seek</h1>

<p>being within the outside<br>
in a voice of my own<br>
to truly have a place<br>
worth something<br>
I've been so many places<br>
done so many things<br>
had so many dreams<br>
fought for nothing</p>

<p>for the glory of<br>
for the silent ones<br>
I seek you<br>
for the end of<br>
for the gathered one<br>
I seek you</p>

<p>will they ever listen<br>
do they think I can't<br>
hear them whispering?<br>
they stare at me</p>
