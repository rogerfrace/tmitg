<h1>Dark Splintered Heart</h1><br />
<h3>inspired by the journal of Abbey Greenbaum</h3>

<p>my mouth opened by a scream<br />
my body bound in chains<br />
my soul corrupted by darkness<br />
my heart filled with pain<br />
my eyes burned with images<br />
my ears ringing with bells<br />
my stomach taken by nausea<br />
my hands pierced with nails</p>

<p>body to body, fear to fear<br />
eye to eye, tear to tear<br />
body to body, pain to pain<br />
mouth to mouth, again and again&hellip;</p>

<p>all that i wanted, all that i could<br />
of your deep dark splintered heart<br />
i do what i know, i do what i should<br />
dear god don't tear me apart</p>

<p>my eyes saw your troubles<br />
my mouth spoke your words<br />
my ears heard your screams<br />
my ideas destroyed your world</p>

<p>body to body, fear to fear<br />
eye to eye, tear to tear<br />
body to body, pain to pain<br />
mouth to mouth, again and again&hellip;</p>

<p>all that i wanted, all that i could<br />
of your deep dark splintered heart<br />
i do what i know, i do what i should<br />
dear god don't tear me apart</p>

<p>all that you wanted, all that you could<br />
see the pain in my eyes<br />
drive your anger into my soul<br />
don't know the reasons why</p>

<p>all that i wanted, all that i could<br />
of your deep dark splintered heart<br />
i do what i know, i do what i should<br />
dear god don't tear me apart</p> 

</body>
