It was great to meet all of the very nice people there. We are definitely very honored we were able to be part of such an incredible event for a great cause. Thanks to everyone who came and supported us. Check the <a href=\"http://www.tmitg.com/images.php\">images page</a> to see some photos that were taken.<br>We have new t-shirts available! Those of you who came to New Orleans saw the new design. We have now made them available for order <a href=\"http://www.tmitg.com/merch.php\">here</a>.
