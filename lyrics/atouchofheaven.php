<h1>a Touch of Heaven</h1>

<p>understand, can't you see<br>
don't you know the fire in me<br>
burning flesh, boiling blood<br>
take it away, let me dream</p>

<p>crying and screaming for a touch of heaven<br>
yelling and dying want a touch of heaven<br>
all i want, all i want is a touch of heaven<br>
only you you can give me a touch of heaven</p>

<p>mind screaming, lying alone<br>
body dying, turned to stone<br>
release me from torture, dreaming a living hell<br>
can't you tell, all i need is a touch of heaven</p>

<p><em>touch the earth<br>
want to touch the sky<br>
need a touch of heaven right now</em></p>
