<h1>The Inside World</h1>

<p>I have lost today<br>
The vision passed<br>
You'll see the same<br>
Within confusion</p>

<p>Nothing but the same<br>
All monotony<br>
Nothing but knowing<br>
Time is leaving</p>

<p>It's reaching toward me<br>
On the foreign sands<br>
Words will find a way<br>
To heal my past</p>

<p>And the tables will turn<br>
Your choice is made<br>
I understand<br>
It must be this way</p>

<p>Looking through the pieces<br>
Of my mind - a betrayal<br>
Following the footsteps<br>
Of the real world - it's blinding</p>

<p>And I never dream<br>
They don't come to me<br>
I sit in isolation<br>
Finding peace</p>

<p>This is not a game<br>
They don't know the rules<br>
I find a way<br>
To use it against them all</p>

<p>I'm not losing my mind<br>
If it's all the same<br>
If you can find<br>
Another thing to say</p>

<p>You know the truth<br>
They can't know my name<br>
To see the power<br>
I've already gained</p>
