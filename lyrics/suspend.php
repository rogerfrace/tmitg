<h1>Suspend</h1>

<p>Trapped in time<br>
At the edge of reality<br>
If I could stand<br>
And look it in the eyes<br>
And change back<br>
To the way things were<br>
Take everything away<br>
So I am not suspended<br>
Suspended above my life<br>
Hovering around my fears<br>
Feelings change<br>
You've changed too</p>

<p>And I can't speak<br>
And I can't know<br>
And I'm not alone<br>
And I fall</p>

<p>And I am far<br>
And I am fear<br>
And my tears flood<br>
And I fall</p>

<p>And I can't see<br>
And I can't leave<br>
And I'm far beyond<br>
And I fall</p>

<p>And I am near<br>
And I am real<br>
And my heart longs<br>
And I am</p>
