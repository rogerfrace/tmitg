<h1>Prophetic Bird</h1>

<p>Let me tell you of a time in the distant past<br>
Of a girl and a bird with knowledge vast<br>
She who knows all of beast and man<br>
Of gods and heroes throughout the land</p>

<p>Islands far, far out to sea<br>
All alone within your tree<br>
The secret fate of all the world<br>
Ahead, foretold and unfurled</p>

<p>Gamayun, won't you sing your tune?<br>
Beautiful, prophetic bird</p>

<p>Let me tell you of a time in the distant past<br>
A deity of wisdom, the die was cast<br>
Singing herself a divine melody<br>
A voice throaty and velvety</p>

<p>Her song weaves a web of magic and fate<br>
Hard to interpret until it's too late<br>
Who among us can comprehend?<br>
Not I, for certain, dear friend</p>

<p>Gamayun, won't you sing your tune?<br>
Beautiful, prophetic bird</p>

<p>Let me tell you of a time in the distant past<br>
Of elements and nature, the world vast<br>
Sun, rain, wind, animals and birds<br>
Plants and trees, they hear her words</p>

<p>Ancient origins and time now lost<br>
Opulence and decadence at great cost<br>
Her song now gone and dreams now hushed<br>
Wings and feathers, in the ground, crushed</p>

<p>Gamayun, won't you sing your tune?<br>
Beautiful, prophetic bird</p>
