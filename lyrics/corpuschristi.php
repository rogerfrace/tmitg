<h1>Corpus Christi</h1> 
<h3>words by John McDonagh</h3>

<p>the night dragged by on the altar of repose<br />
with something funereal about the white rose<br />
the deep rumbling of the organ screamed revenge<br />
for the hours of desolation within</p>

<p>kneeling there in prayer she wept<br />
for the loss of her life and the boy who slept<br />
never to see her again in the falling rain<br />
she cried out loud, she cried in pain</p>

<p><em>lost to him and lost to her<br />
the love flies blindly in an empty world<br />
finding naught but pain and death inside<br />
leaves our world to hate and desire</em></p>

<p>the illumination in the chapel dimmed<br />
as the candle lit lamps burned in the wind<br />
the draft of God came in to pray<br />
with those inside who remembered judgment day</p>

<p>come Monday the black robes find it as quiet as sin<br />
the day before, the crowds came in, to get<br />
a piece of the sacrament that can save<br />
them from the memory of that rainy day</p>

<p>if there's pain inside &mdash; love will die<br />
if there's hate inside &mdash; love will die</p>
